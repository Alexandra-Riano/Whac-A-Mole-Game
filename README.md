# Whac-A-Mole-Game
A Whac-A-Mole game inspired by my dog Mila.

This Whac-A-Mole game was desgined using HTML,CSS and JavaScript. The purpose of this project was to practice JavaScript as well as improving my portfolio. I made a few tweaks to make it a little different than a regular Whac-A-Mole game. I used a picture of my beloved dog Mila to model as the mole and renamed it Whac-A-Mila. Have fun!
